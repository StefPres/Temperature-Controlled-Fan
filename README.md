# Weather-Station
A small box that monitors the temperature and humidity. If the temperature goes above a certain point, a fan is turned on.
A temperature and humidity sensor mounted on the outside of the box measures the conditions around it.
The temperature and humidity are then displayed on an LCD screen.
If the temperature goes above 15 degrees Celcius, the fan turns on at 30% power. Above 30, it goes to 60% power. and above 35, 100% power.
